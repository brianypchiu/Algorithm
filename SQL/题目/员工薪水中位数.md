|1    | A          | 2341   |
|2    | A          | 341    |
|3    | A          | 15     |
|4    | A          | 15314  |
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|7    | B          | 15     |
|8    | B          | 13     |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|10   | B          | 1345   |
|11   | B          | 1221   |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|13   | C          | 2345   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
|15   | C          | 2645   |
|16   | C          | 2652   |
|17   | C          | 65     |

请编写SQL查询来查找每个公司的薪水中位数。挑战点：你是否可以在不使用任何内置的SQL函数的情况下解决此问题。

+-----+------------+--------+
|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |
+-----+------------+--------+
```

题解

```sql
SELECT B.Id,B.Company,B.Salary
FROM  
(
    SELECT E.Company,FLOOR((COUNT(*)-1)/2) AS `beg`,if(COUNT(*) % 2=1,0,1) AS `cnt`
    FROM employee AS E
    GROUP BY E.Company
) AS A
JOIN (
    SELECT E1.Id,E1.Company,E1.Salary, COUNT(E2.Salary) AS `trank`
    FROM employee AS E1
    LEFT JOIN employee AS E2
        ON(E1.company = E2.company AND (E1.salary = E2.salary AND E1.Id > E2.Id OR E1.Salary > E2.Salary))
    GROUP BY E1.Id,E1.Company,E1.Salary
    ORDER BY E1.Company,E1.Salary
) AS B
    ON (A.company = B.company AND B.trank BETWEEN A.beg AND (A.beg+A.cnt))
```
